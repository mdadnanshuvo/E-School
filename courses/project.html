    <h2>Data Structure and Algorithms</h2>
    <p>"Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a foundational course that teaches students the fundamental concepts and techniques for designing, analyzing, and implementing efficient algorithms and data structures. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and hands-on programming assignments, students will learn how to apply these principles to solve real-world problems.

In this course, students will study various types of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and learn how to choose the right data structure for a given problem. They will also learn how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, and use this analysis to determine the efficiency of different approaches to solving a problem.

Students will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge through a series of programming assignments and projects, in which they will implement and compare different algorithms and data structures in a variety of contexts.

Overall, this course is designed to give students a strong foundation in the principles of computer science, and to equip them with the skills they need to tackle complex problems in their future careers."</p>

     <ul class="course-outcomes">
      
 <li>Understand the basic principles of data structures and algorithms, and be able to select and implement the appropriate data structure or algorithm for a given problem.</li>
  <li>Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, and be able to compare the efficiency of different approaches to solving a problem.</li>
  <li>Implement basic data structures and algorithms in a programming language, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</li>
  <li>Understand the trade-offs involved in choosing different data structures and algorithms, and be able to make informed decisions about which ones to use in different situations.</li>
  <li>Understand the fundamental concepts of computer science, including asymptotic analysis, recursion, and dynamic programming, and be able to apply these concepts to solve real-world problems.</li>
  <li>Be able to apply the knowledge and skills gained in this course to tackle complex problems in their future careers, and have a strong foundation for further study in computer science and related fields.</li>

    <div class="time-estimate">
  <p>Tentative time to complete this course:</p>
  <ul>
     <li>Prior knowledge and experience: Students who have a strong foundation in computer science concepts and programming may be able to complete the course in less time than those who are new to these topics.</li>
  <li>Pace of the course: Some DSA courses may be taught at a faster pace than others, which could affect the amount of time it takes to complete the course.</li>
  <li>Amount of time devoted to the course each week: The amount of time a student is able to devote to the course each week can also impact the length of time it takes to complete the course. Students who are able to devote more time to the course each week may be able to complete it in less time than those who have less time available.</li>
