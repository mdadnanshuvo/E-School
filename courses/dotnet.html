    <h2>.NET</h2>
    <p>NET is a free, open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern applications. It includes a runtime environment, a comprehensive set of libraries, and tools for building and deploying applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

In a .NET course, students will learn how to use the .NET framework to build a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, and cloud-based services. They will learn how to use programming languages such as C# and Visual Basic, as well as the ASP.NET web development framework and the Xamarin framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.

Students will also learn how to use .NET to access data from a variety of sources, including databases, APIs, and the cloud, and will gain hands-on experience building and deploying .NET applications.

Overall, a .NET course is designed to give students the skills and knowledge they need to become proficient in building modern applications using the .NET framework, and to be able to apply these skills in a variety of contexts.</p>
